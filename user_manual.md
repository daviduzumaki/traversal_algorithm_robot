# 1.0 **General Information**
This section just explains the system in general terms and the purpose that it is intended for.

## 1.1 **System Overview**
The main idea of this project revolves around various path finding algorithms, such as BFS, DFS, Greedy, A*, and Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm. The purpose is to visualize how these algorithms work internally to provide a better understanding for anyone who has difficulty grasping the various algorithms.
The software implements maze generation. The program will allow for a user to generate a grid of a range of sizes, draw their own grid in real-time, determine animation speed and generate random mazes for use of ease.

## 1.2 **Format Of User Manual**
The user manual for this program will be made up of 5 sections: General Information, System Summary, Getting Started, Using the Program, and Reporting.

The system summary provides the general overview and layout of the system. This section will include information on both hardware and software requirements.

Getting Started simply explains where to download the maze solver and how to install it onto your computer.

The Using the Program section will underline a detailed the description of the programs functions.

The reporting section will describe a detailed explanation of what the user will be seeing as the run the program.
